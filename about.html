      </h4>
      <p>Welcome to my blog! My name is Pablo Garza, and I'm a Brazilian Jiu jitsu balck belt and former UFC fighter
        turned front-end developer. I began training in mixed martial arts in 2005. Throughout my career, I fought some
        of the best fighters in
        the world, including Mark Hominick and Dustin Poirer, with a record of 16 wins and 4 losses. After retiring from
        MMA in 2013, I decided to move to norway and open a martial arts academy.The venture lead to opening
        two academy's, one in Lillestrøm and the second in Lørenskog. After some years, I decided to pursue a new
        passion for coding and enrolled in a front-end web development program at Noroff. Today, I'm proud to say that
        I'm well on my way to becoming a skilled (noob) developer and hope to one day launch my own tech startup, just
        kidding that would be crazy!. When I'm not coding, I love spending time with my fantastic girl-friend and two
        children and staying active.
        Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope you enjoy reading about my journey!</p>

      <h3 class="subject-title">Deep Dive</h3>
      <p>I was born in Wasco, California to parents who had emigrated from Mexico. Growing up, my family and I
        eventually made
        our way to North Dakota where I attended high school and played three different sports: baseball, basketball,
        and track.
        Among these, basketball held a special place in my heart and I continued to play as a point guard for two years
        in
        college at the University of Jamestown.

        Despite my love for basketball, I knew I needed to think about my future and pursued a degree in exercise
        science and
        personal training at the University of North Dakota. During my time there, I also worked hard at two jobs - one
        at a
        factory that made windmill blades and the other as an intern at a gym. These experiences taught me the value of
        hard
        work and the importance of balancing multiple responsibilities.</p>

      <p>I was at a crossroads in my athletic career when I made the decision to sign with the Ultimate Fighting
        Championship
        (UFC) to compete on The Ultimate Fighter: Team GSP vs. Team Koscheck.

        As the show began, I found myself up against a formidable opponent in Michael Johnson, a highly regarded
        prospect in the
        sport. Despite my best efforts, I ultimately fell short and suffered a defeat to him in a two-round decision.
        While the
        loss was disappointing, it only fueled my desire to continue to improve and come back stronger in future bouts.

    <div>
      In October 2010, World Extreme Cagefighting merged with the Ultimate Fighting Championship. As part of the merger,
      all
      WEC fighters were transferred to the UFC.[10]

      Garza made his UFC and featherweight debut against Fredson Paixão at The Ultimate Fighter: Team GSP vs. Team
      Koscheck
      Finale.[11] This was the first ever featherweight fight in the UFC. Garza knocked Paixão out 51 seconds into the
      first
      round with a flying knee. After being unconscious for nearly two minutes, Paixão was on his back for close to four
      minutes while being given oxygen, before being placed in a neck brace and carried out on a stretcher. Garza earned
      Knockout of the Night honors for the performance.[12]

      Garza defeated Yves Jabouin on April 30, 2011 at UFC 129 via first round submission due to a flying triangle
      choke.[13]
      The finish earned him Submission of the Night honors and $129,000.

      Garza faced Dustin Poirier on November 12, 2011 at UFC on Fox 1.[14] He lost the fight in the second round after
      tapping
      out to a d'arce choke.

      Garza next faced Dennis Bermudez at UFC on Fox 3 on May 5, 2012.[15] He lost the fight via unanimous decision
      (30-27,
      30-27, 30-27).

      Garza was expected to face Josh Grispi on August 4, 2012 at UFC on FOX 4.[16] However, Garza was forced out of the
      bout
      with an injury and replaced by Rani Yahya.[17]

      Garza faced Mark Hominick on November 17, 2012 at UFC 154.[18] He won the fight by unanimous decision.

      Garza faced Diego Brandão on April 6, 2013 at UFC on Fuel TV 9.[19] He lost the fight via first round submission
      and was
      subsequently released from the promotion.[20]
