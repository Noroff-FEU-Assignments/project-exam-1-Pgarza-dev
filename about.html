          Norway.
        </h4>
        <p>Welcome to my blog! My name is Pablo Garza, and I'm a Brazilian Jiu jitsu balck belt and former UFC fighter
          turned front-end developer. I began training in mixed martial arts in 2005. Throughout my career, I fought
          some
          of the best fighters in
          the world, including Mark Hominick and Dustin Poirer, with a record of 16 wins and 4 losses. After retiring
          from
          MMA in 2013, I decided to move to norway and open a martial arts academy.The venture lead to opening
          two academy's, one in Lillestrøm and the second in Lørenskog. After some years, I decided to pursue a new
          passion for coding and enrolled in a front-end web development program at Noroff. Today, I'm proud to say that
          I'm well on my way to becoming a skilled (noob) developer and hope to one day launch my own tech startup, just
          kidding that would be crazy!. When I'm not coding, I love spending time with my fantastic girl-friend and two
          children and staying active.
          Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope you enjoy reading about my journey!</p>

        <h3 class="subject-description">I was born in Wasco, California to parents who had emigrated from Mexico.</h3>
        <p> Growing up, my family and I
          eventually made
          our way to North Dakota where I attended high school and played three different sports: baseball, basketball,
          and track.
          Among these, basketball held a special place in my heart and I continued to play as a point guard for two
          years
          in
          college at the University of Jamestown.

          Despite my love for basketball, I knew I needed to think about my future and pursued a degree in exercise
          science and
          personal training at the University of North Dakota. During my time there, I also worked hard at two jobs -
          one
          at a
          factory that made windmill blades and the other as an intern at a gym. These experiences taught me the value
          of
          hard
          work and the importance of balancing multiple responsibilities.</p>

        <h3 class="subject-title">The Ultimate Fighter: Team Gsp vs Team Koscheck</h3>
        <p>I was at a crossroads in my athletic career when I made the decision to sign with the Ultimate Fighting
          Championship
          (UFC) to compete on The Ultimate Fighter: Team GSP vs. Team Koscheck.

          As the show began, I found myself up against a formidable opponent in Michael Johnson, a highly regarded
          prospect in the
          sport. Despite my best efforts, I ultimately fell short and suffered a defeat to him in a two-round decision.
          While the
          loss was disappointing, it only fueled my desire to continue to improve and come back stronger in future
          bouts.

      <h3 class="subject-title">The Ultimate Fighting Championship</h3>
      <div>
        In October 2010, World Extreme Cagefighting merged with the Ultimate Fighting Championship. As part of the
        merger,
        all
        WEC fighters were transferred to the UFC.

        Garza made his UFC and featherweight debut against Fredson Paixão at The Ultimate Fighter: Team GSP vs. Team
        Koscheck
        Finale. This was the first ever featherweight fight in the UFC. Garza knocked Paixão out 51 seconds into the
        first
        round with a flying knee. After being unconscious for nearly two minutes, Paixão was on his back for close to
        four
        minutes while being given oxygen, before being placed in a neck brace and carried out on a stretcher. Garza
        earned
        Knockout of the Night honors for the performance.

        Garza defeated Yves Jabouin on April 30, 2011 at UFC 129 via first round submission due to a flying triangle
        choke.
        The finish earned him Submission of the Night honors and $129,000.

        Garza faced Dustin Poirier on November 12, 2011 at UFC on Fox 1. He lost the fight in the second round after
        tapping
        out to a d'arce choke.

        Garza next faced Dennis Bermudez at UFC on Fox 3 on May 5, 2012. He lost the fight via unanimous decision
        (30-27,
        30-27, 30-27).

        Garza was expected to face Josh Grispi on August 4, 2012 at UFC on FOX 4. However, Garza was forced out of
        the
        bout
        with an injury and replaced by Rani Yahya.

        Garza faced Mark Hominick on November 17, 2012 at UFC 154. He won the fight by unanimous decision.

        Garza faced Diego Brandão on April 6, 2013 at UFC on Fuel TV 9. He lost the fight via first round submission
        and was
        subsequently released from the promotion.
