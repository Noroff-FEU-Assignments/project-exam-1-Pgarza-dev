      <p>Welcome to my blog! My name is Pablo Garza, and I'm a former UFC fighter turned front-end developer. I
        began training in mixed martial arts in 2005. Throughout my career, I fought some of the best fighters in
        the world, including Mark Hominick and Dustin Poirer, with a record of 16 wins and 4 losses. After retiring from
        MMA
        in 2013, I decided to open a martial arts academy.
        After some years decided to pursue a new passion for coding and enrolled in a front-end web development
        program. Today, I'm proud to say that I'm well on my way to becoming a skilled developer and hope to one day
        launch my own tech startup, just kidding that would be crazy!. When I'm not coding, I love spending time
        with my fantastic girl-friend and two children and staying active. Thank you for visiting my blog, and I
        hope you enjoy reading about my journey!</p>
